# calculator-app
basic calculator app using vanilla javascript and node.js for weekly budget reports.

I didn't spend anytime with CSS yet, so the UI looks bad but the app works as intended.

node takes daily budgets and gives weekly report.

Use console to see total expression.

Use node src/server.js to start server running on port 3000.

console.log displays data until i start working on interface

I used mongoDB to store data for weekly reports, all the functions and models are in the mongoose folder.
